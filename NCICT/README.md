- 20240229
  - Bug fixed: TCM profile for body phantoms not properly selected 
- 20240125
  - Bug fixed: effective diameter and SSDE not updated when scan range changed
- **20240124 Official release version 3.0.20240124**
  - Head CTDI phantom-based tube current modulation profiles were added to more realistically simulate TCM for pediatric patients.
  - The muscle layer in the frontal and rear views of the phantoms were removed to better visualize the internal anatomy.
- 20230428

- **20221214 Official release version 3.0.20221123**
- 20221123
