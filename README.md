# NCI Dose Hub

Welcome to the NCI Dose Hub.

This forum provides access to **reference-grade radiation dose estimation tools**
developed at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), along with documentation and
policy guidance for licensed users.

These tools are intended for:

• Commercial dose management and imaging software vendors  
• Academic or hospital-based dose platforms  
• Population-based dose evaluation, benchmarking, and regulatory-facing analyses  

These tools are **not intended** for:

• Direct clinical decision support  
• Patient-specific or site-customized modeling  
• Real-time clinical dose calculation  

Access to software and data is provided **only under an approved agreement**
(see Licensing & Access below).
